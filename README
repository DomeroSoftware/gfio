## Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use `gfio`:

	# Open a file for writing
	my $fh = gfio::open('example.txt', 'w');
	$fh->write("Hello, World!\n");
	$fh->close;

	# Append data to an existing file
	$fh = gfio::open('example.txt', 'a');
	$fh->append("More data...\n");
	$fh->close;

	# Read from a file
	$fh = gfio::open('example.txt', 'r');
	my $content = $fh->read();
	print "File content: $content\n";
	$fh->close;
